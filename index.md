## Welcome to Anmol's Profile


Currently pursuing a post graduate certification in Data Analytics at Durham College, Canada, I am a graduate in B.Sc. Statistics Hons. from Ram Lal Anand College, University of Delhi. Studying in a very competitive environment has honed my analytical and problem solving skills, building alongside a good operational knowledge of programming languages. My progress has been further boosted in the field of team management and communication being a core member of the Dramatics Society which developed skills such as time management, team leadership and prioritization of work. I strive to unlearn and learn something new everyday.
